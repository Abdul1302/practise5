                  To turn on optical margins in Adobe InDesign,simply
                  select any text box you wish to apply them to and 
                  then open up the (not very intuitively named) “Story”
                  dialog box. You can adjust the degree to which the 
                  punctuation hangs over the edges of the text box to
                  match to match the size of your text or suit your own
                  preferences.
